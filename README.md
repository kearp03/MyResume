# MyResume

This repository contains my resume written in LaTeX as well as the PDF version. Last updated on 2025/3/13.

## Compiling the LaTeX File

You have two options to compile the LaTeX file (`.tex`) into a PDF:

### Using Overleaf

1. Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
2. Create a new project and upload the `.tex` file.
3. Overleaf will automatically compile the `.tex` file into a PDF that you can download.

### Compiling Locally

1. Install a LaTeX distribution, such as TeX Live or MiKTeX.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `.tex` file.
4. Run the command: `pdflatex KyleEarpResume.tex`.
5. This will generate a PDF file in the same directory.
